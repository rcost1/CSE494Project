In this project, we will be visualizing COVID19 psychological effects.

## Progress

* Our data visualization will show the mental health impact of Covid-19 by state. So our users will be anyone who is interested in this impact. This could be Psychologists, Universities, High Schools, Nursing Homes etc. Anyone who is interested in remedying mental health effects would value this information.

* Allow sorting and filtering so users can search for key elements within the data that dynamically updates on the dashboard.
* Gather data by state from visualization -> scrub data -> correlate mental health data with state data -> normalize resulting data -> display data.
* With our dataset we’d like to incorporate Hue to show the negative mental health effects people have had in different regions within the United States. Users can select which view they’d like to see their data in.
* listing all graphics and representations of our data along with a brief description. Users will be able to dynamically make updates to see data from different points of view.

## Changes from feedback

* Only using 1 data source
* Add in innovative visualization with unique nodes
